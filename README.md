# Giphy (change name from first project if thats what its called on git hub)

This application uses the Giphy API to plug Gifs directly into the website. Using an Aplication Program Interface (API) allows for your website to use the utilities gathered from other available websites. This makes it possible for your site offer information from other sites, which would update automatically. You can also use API's to offer maps, make your online store found more easily, or just make your site more entertaining through the use of Gifs.
